 * <li>{@link DeliveryGuarantee#EXACTLY_ONCE}: In this mode the KafkaSink will write all messages in

 Please ensure that you use unique {@link #transactionalIdPrefix}s across your applications running

Also, I think we need to clearly distinguish between specified behaviour and implementation details. The specified behaviour is that it's a unique and immutable string of no more than 22 characters where the allowed character set is the same as the URL-safe base64 variant with no padding (the regex is useful too). These details help people if they want to store this in a DB or use it in places where the character set is restricted.

Then, the implementation detail is that we generate 22 characters today. But, we could potentially reduce this in the future and users should not depend on it being exactly 22 characters.

Does that make sense?

Also, we could perhaps say:

nifi,1983,yjhyjhyjh0,ijokarumawak,"Some databases support fractional seconds (milli or microseconds). By creating java.sql.Time instance from LocalTime, even if the LocalTime has fractional seconds, it will be truncated because Time.valueOf only uses hours, minutes and seconds as follows:

```java
java.sql.Time
    public static Time valueOf(LocalTime time) {
        return new Time(time.getHour(), time.getMinute(), time.getSecond());
    }
```

Can we have this like this instead? This way, we can preserve time precision at milliseconds if the database driver and database server supports it:

```java
final DateTimeFormatter dtFormatter = getDateTimeFormatter(valueFormat);
LocalTime parsedTime = LocalTime.parse(parameterValue, dtFormatter);
LocalDateTime localDateTime = parsedTime.atDate(LocalDate.ofEpochDay(0));
Instant instant = localDateTime.atZone(ZoneId.systemDefault()).toInstant();
time = new Time(instant.toEpochMilli());
```

I confirmed this behavior with MySQL and PostgreSQL. With PostgreSQL, before changing this, when I passed ""18:25:43.511"" JSON value with ISO_LOCAL_TIME format, it's stored without milliseconds, ""18:25:43"". With above change, using new Time(Long) constructor, I was able to preserve milliseconds ""18:25:43.511"".

Unfortunately MySQL JDBC Driver has a known issue that it truncates milliseconds [76775](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=76775), so we can't store millisecond with MySQL currently (TIMESTAMP works though).",1,False

and `flink-runtime` should not depend on `flink-streaming-java`.

However, the opposite is fine I think, `flink-streaming-java` can depend on `flink-runtime` (there were some plans to eventually merge them IIRC),
so the constant `ENABLE_CHANGE_LOG_STATE_BACKEND` could be moved to `flink-runtime`.

An obvious name would be `TaskConfig`, but it already exists (in `flink-runtime`) and is used for other purposes (other types of tasks).

So how about adding `TaskExecutionConfig` class to `flink-runtime`, package `org.apache.flink.runtime.taskexecutor`, and placing the constant+parsing there?

- doubleValue() on some large or extremely accurate BigDecimals are questionable

You could in theory prove that the signum well never change by rounding. But seeing how Math.abs() behaves on MIN_VALUE, let's not take that risk. Furthermore, this causes auto-inboxing to Number, which will have a performance impact.

Also, keep the operands of the same type, to avoid java-puzzlers-bugs. So keep the second operand specifically a double: `if (impact.doubleValue() < 0.0) {`. (Same goes for longs: in LongScore etc, we use `0L` to send a zero long, not `0`.)

That said, if it feels wrong to not have some common ancestor, then perhaps there *should* be a shared functional interface? At the moment, the only barrier I see preventing a common function for handling events is the variation on whether a handler is `void` or `boolean`, but there may be a better approach than the way things were done in the early guac days. Doing so would simplify the way these events get fired, and would avoid all the `instanceof` checks and casting.",1,True

In this particular case, the version of ValueMatcher from `StringValueMatcherColumnSelectorStrategy` may specialize `getRow()` because it is monomorphic, then eliminate IndexedInts allocation because it can prove that it doesn't escape, and then essentially run the same code as here, in `StringDimensionIndexer.makeIndexingValueMatcher()`. But in production `getRow()` in `StringValueMatcherColumnSelectorStrategy` won't be inlined, so `IndexedInts` indirection wrapping `int[]` array will remain.

geode,7418,BalaKaza,DonalEvans,"This logic is different from the logic in the equivalent method in `LPopDUnitTest`, in that here we're saying that the actual element count of the popped element should not differ from the expected count by more than one, whereas in `LPopDUnitTest`, we have that the expected count is one less than the current element count AND that the actual element of the popped element should not differ from the expected count by more than one. This means that in the LPOP test, we actually tolerate differences of 1 - 2 in element count rather than 1 - 0 as we do in this test.

I think that to make it clearer exactly what we're expecting, the logic in both tests could be modified to be something like:
```
          // Allow the actual count to be exactly one greater than the expected count
          int allowedCount = elementCount + 1;
          String[] chunks = element.split(""-"");
          int actualCount = Integer.parseInt(chunks[4]);
          assertThat(actualCount).isEqualTo(allowedCount);
          // Set elementCount for the next element
          elementCount = actualCount + 1;
```
The final line here is important, as without it, `elementCount` will still be off by 1 on the next iteration of the loop, since we need to both increment elementCount each loop AND skip one element in the event that we got a duplicated pop due to client retries. Without this adjustment, if we ever got two duplicated pops in the same test, the test would fail, despite this logic being intended to make the test tolerant of client retries.

Alternately, this logic could be refactored to avoid the use of an if statement and using `satisfiesAnyOf()` instead:
```
      try {
        element = jedis.rpop(key);
        String[] chunks = element.split(""-"");
        int actualCount = Integer.parseInt(chunks[4]);
        int expectedCount = elementCount;
        assertThat(actualCount)
            .as(""Actual element count did not match expected element count for element "" + element)
            .satisfiesAnyOf(
                count -> assertThat(count).isEqualTo(expectedCount),
                count -> assertThat(count).isEqualTo(expectedCount + 1));
        elementCount = actualCount + 1;

I think this change is fine the way it is, but we might want to consider refactoring this in the future.

Even having a static list of registered ""filtering"" or ""updating"" interfaces in this class might be better, and allow the resource provider code to only interact with that strategy interface.

As I mentioned, this current change is fine, but we might want to consider refactoring this if we find that other artifact types need to be persisted, and then retrieved in some custom fashion.  ",1,True

Then connection is established to what our network stack thinks is 1.2.3.4, but is really our malicious router redirecting the connection. Now the malicious host will respond with a valid signed certificate for ""locator1.malicious.com"" and we will happily verify it.

Following the line of thought on sink() or sendTo() methods, here are the few things that we had talked about in another PR #51 
- if sink() is only send to non-stream terminals, maybe we should define SinkFunction as SinkFunction(M message, TaskCoordinator coordinator), removing the MessageCollector parameter there?
- For sendTo(), if we implemented SAMZA-1101, it would be translated into an OutputOperatorSpec, which only contains StreamSpec, keyExtractor, msgExtractor, instead of an actual SinkFunction?

Use the ""Interface Segregation Principle"" and create a new (partial) interface which would have this new method. Something like `StatusProvider` (not necessary the perfect name, but I would not go neither too generic or narrow). Relevant classes might implement this interface as well (The best would be if only `JettyServer` would need to do this, not `HeadlessNiFiServer` or `MiNiFiServer`) the same way as now. The given instance should be exposed to the client (`BootstrapListener`) via this interface.

pulsar,19153,dlg99,BewareMyPower,"I see some chained calls like:

```java
                                topicEventsDispatcher.notifyOnCompletion(
                                        topicEventsDispatcher.notifyOnCompletion(res,
                                                topicName.toString(), TopicEvent.CREATE),
                                        topicName.toString(), TopicEvent.LOAD);
```

It looks a little complicated. I also noticed the returned value is never used except this chained call. It's also unnecessary because

```java
future.whenComplete((r, e) -> f1(r,e)).whenComplete((r, e) -> f2(r, e));
```

works nearly the same as

```java
future.whenComplete((r, e) -> { f1(r, e); f2(r,e); });
```

I think a better API could be like:

```java
    public <T> void notifyOnCompletion(CompletableFuture<T> future, String topic,
                                       TopicEventsListener.TopicEvent... events) {
        future.whenComplete((__, ex) -> {
            final var stage = (ex == null)
                    ? TopicEventsListener.EventStage.SUCCESS
                    : TopicEventsListener.EventStage.FAILURE;
            for (var event : events) {
                notify(topic, event, stage, ex);
            }
        });
    }
```

> required: Elasticsearch index. Flink supports both static index and dynamic index.
If you want to have a static index, this option value should be a plain string, e.g. 'myusers', all the records will be consistently written into ""myusers"" index.
If you want to have a dynamic index, you can use '{field_name}' to reference a field value in the record to dynamically generate a target index. You can also use '{field_name|date_format_string}' to convert a field value of TIMESTAMP/DATE type into the format specified by date_format_string. The date_format_string is compatible with Java's [SimpleDateFormat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html). For example, if the option value is 'myusers-{log_ts|yyyy-MM-dd}', then a record with `log_ts` field value `2020-03-27 12:25:55` will be written into ""myusers-2020-03-27"" index.

* get some project with Native Image:

* Open `sieve/java/algorithm` in NetBeans

* Build (with GraalVM 20.3 or 21.0 as the Java Platform set in _File/Project Properties/Build/Compile_)
* Native Image binary is generated
* Select Files tab and expand `target` folder
* Choose the `sieve` executable

What about leveraging the existing `ResourceAction#notifyAllocationFailure` method. We could say that we not only call this method in case of a failed pending slot request but also if we remove a slot. Then unregistering a `TaskManager` from the `SlotManager` would remove the slots which then would trigger for each allocated slot the `notifyAllocationFailure` message.

- if sink() is only send to non-stream terminals, maybe we should define SinkFunction as SinkFunction(M message, TaskCoordinator coordinator), removing the MessageCollector parameter there?
- For sendTo(), if we implemented SAMZA-1101, it would be translated into an OutputOperatorSpec, which only contains StreamSpec, keyExtractor, msgExtractor, instead of an actual SinkFunction?

I suspect the original intent was to fail with an exception if the same complex type was registered with different serializers, however that might have been lost along the way. Maybe it would be best to rework this to check that a serde _of the expected type_ is registered, and if it's not, register it, and if it is but not the same type, fail with the exception. Maybe something like:

```
  public static <T extends ComplexMetricSerde> void registerSerde(String type, Class<T> clazz, Supplier<T> serdeSupplier)
  {
    if (complexSerializers.containsKey(type)) {
      if (!complexSerializers.get(type).getClass().getCanonicalName().equals(clazz.getCanonicalName())) {
        throw new ISE(
            ""Incompatible serializer for type[%s] already exists. Expected [%s], found [%s]."",

            complexSerializers.get(type).getClass().getCanonicalName()
        );
      }
    } else {
      complexSerializers.put(type, serdeSupplier.get());
    }
  }

Either approach (or some third option if you've got other ideas) is totally fine with me.  But as-is at least this test just doesn't validate all that much.

If you want to go with the first option (reworking this to assert on the remote-message), then AddReplicaPropertyAPITest might be a good reference.  That test makes an API call and uses a special type of mock called an ""ArgumentCaptor"" to record the ""remote message"", so that the test can assert on it later.

The key bits in AddReplicaPropertyAPITest are:

```
    messageCapturer = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(ZkNodeProps.class);
```
(creates the argument-captor)

```
    addReplicaPropApi.addReplicaProperty(

b) the number of tasks consuming the input system streams are now the upstream tasks that are sending EoS to the output

BTW, I think delegating the EoS propagation to EoSDispatcher is fine. But I felt that it should not be wrapped in the EoSManager. IMO, EoSDispatcher is equivalent to ControlPropagateTopology, with additional function to actually send the EoS messages down. The following comments as a summary:
1. I think EoSDispatcher should keep the topology information separate from EoSManager. There should be APIs for the EoSManager to query the set of input streams to an IONode consuming an input stream A, which allows EoSManager makes a decision whether an EoS needs to be propagated via the topology from the current Task.
2. EoSManager should only keep the EoS logic within a TaskContext and also determine within the TaskContext whether an EoS needs to be propagated to all intermediate streams.
3. After EoSManager determines that from the current TaskContext, we need to propagate the EoS to all output streams of the IONode, it can delegate the propagation operation to EoSDispatcher, which should have the information about how many tasks are publishing to the intermediate topics",1,True

I find docs that describe behavior to be more 
readable (instead of docs that get into the weeds).

Wondering if we could slightly re-word this:

```
Issues a heartbeat to the coordinator and returns a 
{@link HeartBeatResponse}. 

Here's the description of the protocol between the 
container and the coordinator:

The heartbeat request contains a <code> containerId
 </code> that identifies the container from which the
 request is made. The coordinator validates the provided
 containerId against its list of containers that should be 
running and returns a {@link HeartBeatResponse}. 

The returned {@link HeartBeatResponse#isalive()} is 
<code> true </code> iff. the coordinator has determined 
that the container is valid and should continue running.

But reading through the actual use of these `Handlers` in the `ExecutorService` instance hanging off of `HRegionServer`, and `HMaster` I can only conclude that the above throw was only wishful thinking. There's even a [comment](https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/678b142da2b75ab6697125bbfdd33e32851650bf/hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/master/HMaster.java#L1381-L1387) (emphasis mine):

The author of the above comment speaks wistfully of what i can only assume is [`HRegionServer#uncaughtExceptionHandler`](https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/8e26761fd01408471a25d481afed64faf34f7574/hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/regionserver/HRegionServer.java#L625-L626). However, it doesn't appear that this is threaded down into the executor service, which means this line's `throw` statement is simply logged and ignored.

So yes, I think removing the `throw` is the right choice. It removes the false sense of handling this error condition correctly. It's really the `abort` that protects the content of the memstore.

Also, why is there not a named exception thrown by the memstore when it cannot flush? Seems like a useful point in that data structure's API.",1,True

I wonder if we need to make the ""port"" configurable, it is be a ""specific"" value for each implementation

If you want to let the bookie ""compose"" the base URL of the service you will need protocol + hostname + port, and not just the port. We can add a method to the HttpServer interface to make the Bookie query the httpserver for the actual endpoint URL

Ideas:
1) make at least port/address/protocol (http/https) configurable
2) leave the 'port' parameter to each specific httpserver implementation (drop it from ServerConfiguration)

An example:  in my case I will run my bookie inside a JVM which alredy bundles its own Tomcat based server and I will implement an HttpServlet. The ""configuration"" of the actual http endpoint will not be known to the Bookie at all.

In this case the httpserver port attribute will be ignored and I know that my case will  work, but now that we are introducing this new feature a would like to have only the minimal set of configuration options.

We can show the GC target size, and `GCCPUFraction` gives us how much CPU time has been spent in GC in a way we can use as the percentage.

- T0+1: file2 is created

- T0+5001: file2 is listed and it is old enough (5001 - 1 = 5000 ms), so it passes the test and will be processed

The problem is that file2 also sets the latest modification time to T0+1 so file1 will not be listed in the next iteration either.

Because this hard to know beforehand, I would suggest just doing the worst case and assuming 5 bytes.  

Also could take the strategy of only tracking the length of long values and asking the buffer for the size of everything else.  This way an accurate size for what is already serialized is obtained and we only need to estimated what is about to be serialized.

  long estimatedNewSize = (cfLength + cqLength + valLength + cv.lenght() + 4* 5 + 1 + (hasTs ? 8 : 0)) + buffer.currentSize() + valueLenghts;

Endpoint identification will fail if e.g. the lookup returned a fully-qualified name but the certificate had just a (non-fully-qualified) hostname in a Subject Alternate Name field.

In version 1.15.0 member identifiers were changed so that if a bind address is specified, that exact string will be carried as the host name.

flink,8495,1u0,pnowojski,"Here are some comments/suggestions:
- `TestingInputsLocationsRetriever` has a dependency to `JobVertex` – I don't think this dependency is justified. 
- Job graph always has a parallelism of 3. However, a parallelism higher than 1 is not necessary relevant for all tests.
- It is implicitly encoded in `createSimpleInputsLocationsRetriever()` that the first half of the execution vertices are producers (the other half are consumers). This makes the tests and the assertions hard to read because I have to first read `createSimpleInputsLocationsRetriever()` in `setUp()` to understand what the test asserts.
- The tests are not asserting the contract of `ExecutionSlotAllocator`: 
  - Tests should assert on the public methods of the interface, i.e., we should assert against the return type of `allocateSlotsFor` (`Collection<SlotExecutionVertexAssignment>`)
  - `@VisibleForTesting` is a code smell
- test name should describe what is being tested, e.g., the expected behavior

Find below a draft of how the tests could look like. Feel free to adapt. Let me know what you think.

Following the line of thought on sink() or sendTo() methods, here are the few things that we had talked about in another PR #51 
- if sink() is only send to non-stream terminals, maybe we should define SinkFunction as SinkFunction(M message, TaskCoordinator coordinator), removing the MessageCollector parameter there?
- For sendTo(), if we implemented SAMZA-1101, it would be translated into an OutputOperatorSpec, which only contains StreamSpec, keyExtractor, msgExtractor, instead of an actual SinkFunction?

```java
(knownVersion.getClientServerProtocolVersion()).getClientServerProtocolVersion()
```

But that expression is not meaningful. The first parenthesized sub-expression is the client-server protocol version. But that thing shouldn't have a client-server protocol version (the whole expression.)

On the other hand, I can see the value of a client version knowing other stuff that a `KnownVersion` knows, such as `major`, `minor`, and `patch`. If those things are important to you then I think there are two options:

1. add some new class to hold two `KnownVersion` instances: one for the server and another for clients
2. change this field type to `Version` (and change the corresponding constructor argument type) but when you need extra `KnownVersion` info for that (ordinal) version, use `Versioning.getKnownVersionOrDefault()` to get at it.

OTOH it doesn't even make a lot of sense to talk about the major+minor+patch components of a _client-server protocol_ version since the latter does not change independently of our product versions. My option (2) might be useful for: ""looking up the most recent `KnownVersion` (a product version), in which the client-server protocol identified by a certain `Version`, changed"".

Based on our discussion earlier, I don't think that we are doing to deliver EndOfStream to the user task. Hence, isn't it enough just to return EndOfStream in-memory token?
- Instead of constructing an IncomingMessageEnvelope object w/ special values, I prefer to have specific types for each control token type (i.e. EndOfStream, Watermark, etc). Also, there is a mismatch in semantics when you construct the control token here: the aggregated EndOfStream is for the whole stream, while the IncomingMessageEnvelope has the ssp of the last EndOfStreamMessage's. Should the user task taking the IME care about this ssp? If not, why do we have it there?",1,True

""With 0.5.1, hudi-hadoop-mr-bundle which is used by query engines such as presto and hive includes shaded avro package to support hudi real time queries through these engines. Hudi supports pluggable logic for merging of records. Users provide their own implementation of [HoodieRecordPayload](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/blob/master/hudi-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/common/model/HoodieRecordPayload.java). If you are using this feature, you need to relocate the avro dependencies in your custom record payload class to be consistent with internal hudi shading. You need to add the following relocation when shading the package containing the record payload implementation

```

But lets say the process crashed mid-way for RB_5. 
Next time we restart the pipeline for say C8. again we deduct that c5 is partially failed and we want to rollback. but we don't want to create RB_9 for this,but re-use RB_5 again and get it to completion.

The uniqueness of PANW’s streaming use cases is another reason that we use a self-managed service. We support multi-tenancy. A tenant (a customer) can ingest data at a very high rate (>100k requests per second), or at a very low rate (&lt; 100 requests per second). A Dataflow job runs on VMs instead of Kubernetes, requiring a minimal one vCPU core. With a small tenant, this wastes resources. Our streaming infrastructure supports thousands of jobs, and the CPU utilization is more efficient if we do not have to use one core for a job. It is natural for us to use a streaming engine running on Kubernetes, so that we can allocate minimal resources for a small tenant, for example, using a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) pod with ½ or less vCPU core.

During compaction, Druid overwrites the original set of segments with the compacted set. Druid also locks the segments for the time interval being compacted to ensure data consistency. By default, compaction tasks do not modify the underlying data. You can configure the compaction task to change the query granularity or add or remove dimensions in the compaction task. This means that the only changes to query results should be the result of intentional, not automatic, changes.

For compaction tasks, `dropExisting` for underlying ingestion tasks is ""true"". This means that Druid can drop or mark unused all the un-compacted segments fully within interval for the compaction task. For an example of why this is important, see the suggestion for reindexing with finer granularity under [Implementation considerations](native-batch.md#implementation-considerations). 
```

            String[] versionMajorParts = version.split(Pattern.quote(remainderDelimiter), 2);

            String[] stringParts = versionMajorParts[0].split(""\\."");
            int[] parts = new int[stringParts.length];

            }

            return new Version(parts, versionMajorParts.length > 1 ? versionMajorParts[1] : """");

The `Version` attributes can be final, if they are initialized in the contructor:

```java
        private Version(int[] parts, String remainder) {
            if(parts == null) {
                throw new NullPointerException(""parts must not be null"");

            this.parts = parts;
            this.remainder = remainder;
        }
```

```java
      private Version trim(int level) {
            if (isUnknown()) {
                return this;
            } else {

    - Using the country code(s), it resolves the proper country name according to the locale that was passed along the method from the properties file that was already pre-loaded upon startup

beam,15400,jrmccluskey,lostluck,"I think I understand the other bugs that have been happening when a runner doesn't understand the combine_globally urn. And now I feel like I've wasted your time for a few weeks. Very sorry about that :/.

This change is removing the fallback behaviour from the pipeline graph for unknown composites. The intent of that is to build up sub transforms that do the same work as the URN that is implementing them.

The existing code for beam.Combine added a fixed key, then deferred to CombinePerKey, which meant that downstream in graphx/translate.go it lost any sense of the ""global"" nature of this particular transform.  But also, I don't think I've explained how CombinePerKey as a composite transform works. If you read the original combine per key code, note that it always adds a TryGroupByKey, and follows it by a NewCombine.

So in the case of a GlobalCombine, what we want is to 
1. Add the ""magic scope"" (`graph.CombineGloballyScope`).
2. AddFixedKey + TryGroupByKey + NewCombine + DropKey
3. In graphx, we check and detect the magic scope and conditions (similarly to how we're doing it for CombinePerKey).

It's very important that we have a composite 2 with all those contents, since that's what needs to get executed by the runner if it doesn't understand the URN at all. ""NewCombine"" by itself doesn't actually do any grouping.

Basically, in principal, there shouldn't be any need for the Direct runner to change, (with new nodes or anything) since it's the kind of runner that will rely on the fallbacks.

Lets say we have 
Data_block_1
Delete_block_2
Data_block_3

where in, data_block_3 has some records inserted again which was deleted in delete_block_2.

w/o any minor compaction, when we do snapshot read, we should be able to read the deleted records which are re-inserted again(since data_block_3 wins). 

But according to this new logic, won't we compact like
Data_block_1, Data_block_3, Delete_block_2.

On which case, the deletion will win over-riding the data_block_3.

A proxy server is a go‑between or intermediary server that forwards requests from multiple clients to different servers across the Internet. The proxy server acts as a “traffic cop,” in both forward and reverse proxy scenarios, and adds various benefits in your system such as load balancing, performance, security, auto-scaling, etc.. There are already many proxy servers already available in the market which are fast, scalable and more importantly covers various essential security aspects that are needed by the large organization to securely share their confidential data over the network. Pulsar provides proxy implementation which acts as a reverse proxy and creates a gateway in front of brokers. However, pulsar doesn’t provide support to use other proxies such as Apache traffic server (ATS), HAProxy, Nginx, Envoy those are more scalable and secured. Most of these proxy-servers support SNI ROUTING which can route traffic to a destination without having to terminate the SSL connection. Routing at layer 4 gives greater transparency because the outbound connection is determined by examining the destination address in the client TCP packets.

`SimpleSlotProvider` will fail immediately with a `NoResourceAvailableException` if there is not enough resources. We can set the slot num to be parallelism - 1 when constructing `SimpleSlotProvider` to keep the same behavior of the tests.

```
	@Test
	public void testRestartWithSlotSharingAndNotEnoughResources() throws Exception {

		final int parallelism = 20;

		final SlotSharingGroup sharingGroup = new SlotSharingGroup();

		source.setParallelism(parallelism);
		source.setSlotSharingGroup(sharingGroup);

		final JobVertex sink = new JobVertex(""sink"");

		sink.setParallelism(parallelism);
		sink.setSlotSharingGroup(sharingGroup);
		sink.connectNewDataSetAsInput(source, DistributionPattern.POINTWISE, ResultPartitionType.PIPELINED_BOUNDED);

		TestRestartStrategy restartStrategy =

		eg.start(mainThreadExecutor);
		eg.scheduleForExecution();

		// the last suppressed restart is also counted
		assertEquals(numRestarts + 1, eg.getNumberOfRestarts());

5. If no, the broker verifies whether a schema can be automatically created in this namespace:
  * If `isAllowAutoUpdateSchema` sets to **true**, then a schema can be created, and the broker validates the schema based on the schema compatibility check strategy defined for the topic.
  * If `isAllowAutoUpdateSchema` sets to **false**, then a schema can not be created, and the consumer is rejected to connect to the broker.

**Tip**:
`isAllowAutoUpdateSchema` can be set via **Pulsar admin API** or **REST API.** 
For how to set `isAllowAutoUpdateSchema` via Pulsar admin API, see [Manage AutoUpdate Strategy](schema-manage.md/#manage-autoupdate-strategy).

If splitting the current restriction is possible, the current restriction is split into a primary and residual restriction pair. This invocation updates the ``current_restriction()`` to be the primary restriction effectively having the current ``DoFn.process()`` execution responsible for performing the work that the primary restriction represents. The residual restriction will be executed in a separate ``DoFn.process()`` invocation (likely in a different process). The work performed by executing the primary and residual restrictions as separate ``DoFn.process()`` invocations MUST be equivalent to the work performed as if this split never occurred.

The ``fraction_of_remainder`` should be used in a best effort manner to choose a primary and residual restriction based upon the fraction of the remaining work that the current ``DoFn.process()`` invocation is responsible for. For example, if a ``DoFn.process()`` was reading a file with a restriction representing the offset range [100, 200) and has processed up to offset 130 with a fraction_of_remainder of 0.7, the primary and residual restrictions returned would be [100, 179), [179, 200) (note: current_offset + fraction_of_remainder * remaining_work = 130 + 0.7 * 70 = 179).

It is very important for pipeline scaling and end to end pipeline execution that try_split is implemented well.

beam,15239,riteshghorse,lostluck,"It would be more idiomatic to declare the zero value in place for the returns, which makes it explicit that they're the zero value. 
The reason for this is to limit scope, and make it easier on readers. If possible we keep that as small as possible. With a pre-declaration like this, a reader has to keep an eye out for it, for when it's used, and what might have affected it before it's returned. By writing our intent (return a zero value on error) directly where it's happening, we avoid this.

That said, I understand the repetition can be tiresome. You can instead have defined in this function scope helper function

`onError := func(err error) { return  nil, mtime.ZeroTimestamp, typex.PaneInfo{}, err }`

Which you can then call as `return onError(err)` and it will compile down to the same thing.

Each batch written to a table produces a new snapshot. Iceberg tracks snapshots in table metadata until they are expired. Snapshots accumulate quickly with frequent commits, so it is highly recommended that tables written by streaming queries are [regularly maintained](../maintenance#expire-snapshots). [Snapshot expiration](../spark-procedures/#expire_snapshots) is the procedure of removing the metadata and any data files that are no longer needed.

nifi,1278,olegz,markap14,"I think we have a threading issue here. I will try to explain what I think can happen in chronological order, but these things are always difficult to explain. Suppose that we have two threads, T1 and T2. T1 is running in the start() method, while T2 is running in the stop() method. We could have the following series of events:

T1: Line 1281, is calling @OnScheduled method of the Processor. It has set Scheduled State to STARTING.
T2: Enters stop() method and line 1354 returns false because Scheduled State is STARTING.
T2: At line 1391 it sees that onScheduleFuture is not null.
T2: At line 1392, calls onScheduleFuture.cancel(false). However, T1 is still at line 1281. As a result, the call to Future.cancel() returns false because the future is currently executing and false indicates that the active task should not be canceled. So execution drops to the 'else' clause on line 1402.
T1: Finishes invoking the @OnScheduled method and proceeds to line 1287. The call to compareAndSet returns true, changing the Scheduled State to RUNNING.
T2: At line 1412, the call to scheduledState.compareAndSet returns false, because the Scheduled State is no longer STARTING but is now RUNNING. This means that Scheduled State remains RUNNING.
T2: Returns from method.

At this point, the Scheduled State does accurately represent the state that the Processor is operating in. However, the state is still RUNNING. This means that the call to stop() did not actually stop the Processor but in fact had no effect.

Now I realize that this is very much a corner case, where the user would have to click Stop on the Processor at exactly the right time for this to occur. However, if this does happen, the stop() method will return without stopping the Processor. This is a bug.

One simple solution may be to simply look at the return value on line 1412, and if the return value is false, recursively invoke the stop() method again with the same parameters (after exiting the synchronized block). Or, perhaps more cleanly, to wrap the entire outer-most if/else block in a loop that will continue if line 1412 returns false.",1,True

(knownVersion.getClientServerProtocolVersion()).getClientServerProtocolVersion()
```

But that expression is not meaningful. The first parenthesized sub-expression is the client-server protocol version. But that thing shouldn't have a client-server protocol version (the whole expression.)

On the other hand, I can see the value of a client version knowing other stuff that a `KnownVersion` knows, such as `major`, `minor`, and `patch`. If those things are important to you then I think there are two options:

1. add some new class to hold two `KnownVersion` instances: one for the server and another for clients
2. change this field type to `Version` (and change the corresponding constructor argument type) but when you need extra `KnownVersion` info for that (ordinal) version, use `Versioning.getKnownVersionOrDefault()` to get at it.

OTOH it doesn't even make a lot of sense to talk about the major+minor+patch components of a _client-server protocol_ version since the latter does not change independently of our product versions.

But I have the impression that it is possible to end up in the same problem when the leader changes.  Because as far as I see, the new leader will not have build up its cache.  (or even worse has an outdated cache from a previous time it was leader)

Which I think can still cause troubles.

I see two other possible solutions:
- The easiest one to implement I think is keep the previous code, but change the type of the `currentAssignment` parameter from a `Map<String, List<TopicPartition>>` to a `Map<TopicPartition, String>`, or keep the type but do a post-processing step on this list where double TopicPartitions are removed before doing the `sortPartitions`.

- Another possibility is putting a generation counter in the schema, and only keep assignments with the maximum generation counter.  (or those where it is still missing for backwards compatibility).

The first possible solutions is easy to implement but makes it a little less sticky. (which I do not mind)
The second solution is more sound, but implementing it in a backwards compatible way is a challenge.

Partitioning doesn't reduce the size of the data--it doesn't affect the size data at all. What it does is increases data ""locality"". This means that for dimensions you partition on, rows with the same value are stored together, making it quicker for Druid to eliminate any data that doesn't match the on the partitioned dimension.

Consider this example as one segment file:
![](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/assets/druid-column-types.png)

Timestamp is the primary partition. Secondary partitions (on dimensions) are in order. So imagine that `Page` is a secondary partition. In this case all the rows with the same page value are stored together. When Druid executes the. query, it can first check if the timestamp falls within the times included in the segment and only open ones that have relevant timestamps. This is why filtering on time makes things faster. Then, within the time, all the rows for the `Page` are stored together.

Those Parquet files which were written before the new logical types API was introduced don't have the [new logical types](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/src/main/thrift/parquet.thrift#L390) field in the metadata, therefore isSetLogicalType will return false, and the converter won't set any logical type for old files. The goal here was:
- first [read](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/blob/master/parquet-hadoop/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/format/converter/ParquetMetadataConverter.java#L1168) new logical type if present (not present for old files)
- the [read](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/blob/master/parquet-hadoop/src/main/java/org/apache/parquet/format/converter/ParquetMetadataConverter.java#L1171) converted type (this should be present for both old and new files)
- convert the original type to the new parquet-mr logical type representation (converted_type in metadata), then convert the new logical type (logicalType in metadata) to the new parquet-mr logical type representation, compare them, and if they mismatch, then converted_type ""wins"": the annotation in converted_type metadata field should be used. This should work if both logicalType and converted_type is set in schema (after calling getOriginalType they should map to the same), or if logicalType is null (for older files)

With this change the `childBuilder.as(originalType)` is called only when both fields are written, and the case where `logicalType` is null but `converted_type` is not is not handled. The tests are green, because they read/write files using the new API, which sets both fields: unfortunately there is a missing test case for testing backward compatibility. How about something like this instead:
```
      if (schemaElement.isSetConverted_type()) {
        LogicalTypeAnnotation originalType = getOriginalType(schemaElement.converted_type, schemaElement);
        LogicalTypeAnnotation newLogicalType = schemaElement.isSetLogicalType() ? getOriginalType(schemaElement.logicalType) : null;
        if (!originalType.equals(newLogicalType)) {
          childBuilder.as(getOriginalType(schemaElement.converted_type, schemaElement));
        }
      }
```
