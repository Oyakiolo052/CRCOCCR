"I haven't fully thought about this approach yet in terms of the consequences of trying to wait for free memory as I've never tried to do it before but one thing that stands out to me is that there seems like there's always going to be a race condition here. Even if you wait and get the ok that there is memory to proceed by the time you continue and get to this line and go to allocate memory for the byte array there's no guarantee the JVM hasn't already allocated some of the memory you'd need for this to work in another thread. In fact, if you were right on the edge and barely had enough memory then I would think this could fail often with the JVM allocating memory in other threads. In practice though I don't know if that's true without testing but it seems a bit non deterministic since you don't have much control over the GC process and what other threads are doing.","I agree that it's not a perfect solution, it's an attempt at doing something. There are other options that could be added, like only check for free memory if the length is over some size.

"This isn't the standard in Go BTW, and the Diamond Dependency problem isn't as much of a problem. Essentially two different major versions of a package are two different packages as far as the compiler is concerned.

Healthy packages have a major version release to indicate breaking changes the external APIs. And to use a new major version, the imports would need to change as well. 
Otherwise the two distinct major versions of the same can happily live in the same binary.

"This is half comment, half question.

It seems odd to recreate the SyslogParserBuilder every `parse`. I dug in a bit, and I expected (personally expected, not ""Metron itself expects x condition"") this process to be somewhat similar to the enrichment where the bolt implements the `reloadCallback` method (e.g. [UnifiedEnrichmentBolt](https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/1d95b8316a18097747be116a0276c56b894fb79c/metron-platform/metron-enrichment/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/enrichment/bolt/UnifiedEnrichmentBolt.java#L229)) which would then delegate updating the config of the underlying pieces.

E.g. here I would expect the `SyslogParser` to be created a priori and then when the parser config gets updated `reloadCallback` would be called and this would be updated (and in this case recreated).

Looking into it a bit further, it looks like ParserBolt has the appropriate method passed down to it, but chooses not to implement it.  I suspect it's because ~nothing~ none of the underlying parsers don't update configs, although I didn't check all of them.

Would it be reasonable to get that setup in the ParserBolt and then handle the `SyslogParser` object that way, rather than recreating it every time?",You ok with that as part of this pr?,1,1

"Let's let this method throw an exception. Then the calling TaskManager can see the difference between `null` (= no further split) and `Exception` (= something went wrong / is inconsistent).
","I'm not sure that throw a exception by RpcMethod is a good way to do error handling. From the caller's side, when the rpc method returns the Future from gateway, caller can do error handling with handleAsync or exceptionallyAsync now. But the exception from user logic with mess with all the exceptions from rpc framework, like RpcTimeout or other exception that tells you that maybe the rpc system does not work well. So typically you need to try to figure out what went wrong by distinguishing the Exception type, which is not very elegant i think. 
One way we can do is we never throw exception in RpcMethod but deal with error in the ""ErrorCode"" way by return the error explicitly with return value. All the exception thrown when doing rpc call should due to the rpc framework. 
In this situation, returning null is indicating that something wrong with requesting. (If we should know more detail about error, we can rich it by returning message, currently null will do the work)
And in normal case like no further split, we still return a NextInputSplit with empty content in it. I will add some more comments about this.

"If I understand correctly, this changes the behavior of `urlEncodedPemEncodedPeerCertificateChain` such that it will only return the intermediate certificates, and not the leaf certificate, when called from the server context.

From what I could tell nothing outside of tests is currently using this method, so a behavior change is probably okay, but the docs would need to be rationalized.

On the other hand, would it make sense to retain the previous behavior? Is the motivation to avoid duplicating information in case somebody requests both the `cert` and `chain` fields for the xfcc header?

For performance testing we have micro benchmarks.

For correctness we should only check that certain scenarios like, writing x, y, z records or events and/or mixed with broadcasting records/events/watermarks, result with the correct output content of the buffers, regardless of the number/size of the buffers on the output. Otherwise if we optimise/refactor something, all of those tests will start yielding false positive errors.

For example, the below test fails when run against Radish but passes for native Redis:
```
  @Test
  public void testNaNSums() {
    String member = ""member"";
    jedis.zadd(KEY1, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY, member);

Typically it would be that there is a random component in exponential backoff, to avoid this herding. As a first approach, what I suggest here is: choose a random value k between 0 and 2^number of retries - 1. Then retry after k * delay seconds.

"Unfortunately based on my read of the code, I don't think this is quite right:

After this change, we are bailing out if we can't find a reporting process service for the report type. 
Previously, if we couldn't find one, we would continue to execute the ""hardcoded"" reporting process service in the same function below. 

I think continuing execution is the expected behaviour: for any report that is not of type Pentaho or SMS, the report_type is set to Table. But there is no ReportingProcessService with type Table, so therefore the logic in this function below is used to simply prepare the CSV / PDF file. 

In other words: if we check this in, as far as I can see it would break any report that doesn't have a specific report handler configured. 

Now having said that, a good idea would be to create a ""Table"" type report handler and move the code from this function to that report handler. And after that we could assume that there's a handler for each type of report, and bail out if we can't find one. ","@ptuomola I'm finally (7 weeks later, phew!) picking this up, and I'm struggling to understand how the `reportType: SMS` is intended to work... @vidakovic do you understand that? Can those be run on the `/runreports` API? I think what I'll do is just write a `DefaultReportingProcessService` with the current code to which this will delegate to for both `Table` and `SMS`..

"Now that we have `NotOnWindowsDockerRule`, we have the ability for a test to start containers once and to break actual testing into multiple test methods. We do it that way (in `SingleServerSNIAcceptanceTest` and `DualServerSNIAcceptanceTest`) for performance reasons—we don't want to take too many minutes out of our CI pipeline, for SNI testing.

So for these reasons I think we should do one of two things:

1. use `NotOnWindowsDockerRule` here, and break these tests into multiple test methods
2. go further, and transfer these CQ tests over to the `SingleServerSNIAcceptanceTest` class (eliminating this test class entirely)

"I think `--startup DEFAULT` is a redundant option, since it is the default behavior.

I was thinking `--startup ""$jShellPath""` could be used instead of `--startup DEFAULT`, as its replacement. So, the choice we have is to use the default startup or to replace it.

This really comes down to [the difference between an 'option' and a 'parameter'](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36495940/196405), and the fact that the man page says `jshell [options] [load-files]`, implying options should precede file parameters, as is typical for command-line programs.

To explain why this matters, consider the following. In my explanation, I replace the `--startup DEFAULT` option with the `--no-startup` option, to show the differences between options and file parameters, while ignoring the behavioral differences between including the `DEFAULT` startup or not.

Functionally, the following are the same:
```
jshell --startup    conf/jshell-init.jsh <-- replaces the DEFAULT startup with this file
jshell --no-startup conf/jshell-init.jsh <-- skips the DEFAULT startup and only executes this file
```

However, if we're also passing in user options in `$@`, this becomes a problem. To see why, imagine the user executes `bin/accumulo jshell -v userFile.jsh`, then the resulting commands look like:
```
jshell --startup    conf/jshell-init.jsh -v userFile.jsh <-- replaces the DEFAULT startup, also sets the verbose feedback mode, and then executes the user file
jshell --no-startup conf/jshell-init.jsh -v userFile.jsh <-- may work, but mixes [options] with [load-files]
```

I actually tried these both, and jshell did work for me, even though it is not correct according to the manual. It seems jshell is a bit forgiving, at least in the version I have installed. However, we shouldn't count on it working.

And, there is still a difference. If you run `/list -all`, you can see that anything executed as a startup script is listed with the letter `s` followed by a number, and anything executed after, including all commands from `[load-files]` parameters, just gets a number. This matters for user experience, because if you want to reset the state of the jshell using `/reset`, all the startup scripts will re-execute, but any `[load-files]` ones will not (`/reload` would be used instead of `/reset` if you want to re-run the other commands after resetting).

So, this is all to say that I think that we should make sure that when we execute `jshell-init.jsh`, we should ensure that it is done as a `--startup` option, and not as a `[load-files]` parameter. That way, `/reset` and `/reload` behave as expected, and we don't mix and match `[options]` and `[load-files]` arguments when users specify additional options to the command, which may not work in future.

The only downside to this is that if we want any `java.*` imports automatically loaded, we need to include them in the generated file. However, this isn't really a downside, as much as it is an opportunity to tailor our initial imports to avoid any potential conflicts (such as that between `java.util.Scanner` and `org.apache.accumulo.core.client.Scanner`).

```suggestion
      exec ""$cmd"" --startup ""$jShellPath"" ""$@""

"This is very puzzling use of Mockito. Are these two lines trying to set up `findMembers()` to return an empty set? I haven't experimented with this, but I don't this does the right thing.

And I don't think the argument matchers (`eq()` and `anyString()`) are doing anything.

I think the net result of all of this is that you have not mocked `findMembers()` at all. So mockito, by default, returns an empty collection when the method is called.

I'm a little concerned about the impact of taking yet another millisecond clock reading on every message that we dispatch.  This should be run through extensive performance testing before merging it to develop.,I had the same thought. I was even concerned about constantly adding and removing from the concurrent map. We could just use the frequency of the monitor thread to do the time work. For example if it finds an AbstractExecutor in the map that it has not seen before then the monitor thread could set the time it first saw it. If later monitor samples see it again it could use this time (i.e. the one the monitor set) to determine if it is stuck. This could even be done without timestamps. Just a simple counter the monitor incs and the p2p reader thread clears. If the monitor thread is waking up at a fixed interval then you know the thread has been stuck for at least that much time. I like your idea of having custom code in P2PReaderExecutorGroup for this. When I was thinking about it I thought I would need to change the behavior of all the existing threads being monitored.

"Why do the roles need to be returned here?

This is confusing to me `roles` are a set of permissions assigned to a principal. The job of authentication is to identify the user/app and get the principal/app id. For any given authData there should only be one identifier for it. Im my opinion this in the the right way to go about this. 

Roles should only be applicable when performing an authorization check. These roles can be accessed in the authorization provider by reading them from the authdata (this contains the token or cert). The default authorization provider could be updated to have some type of adapter to return the `roles` based on the authdata and principal that gets passed in. Then the default authorization provider can make checks against those roles.

I see this is related to (https://github.com/apache/pulsar/pull/10375)
According the the microsoft docs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens) `roles` are the set of roles that were assigned to the user who is logging in. The `sub` or `oid` can be used to get the identifier of the token

"This doesn't work for all streams since streams can choose to always return 0 or will return 0 if there is a blocking read coming.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html#available()
```
Returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next invocation of a method for this input stream. The next invocation might be the same thread or another thread. A single read or skip of this many bytes will not block, but may read or skip fewer bytes.
Note that while some implementations of InputStream will return the total number of bytes in the stream, many will not. It is never correct to use the return value of this method to allocate a buffer intended to hold all data in this stream.

A subclass' implementation of this method may choose to throw an [IOException](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/IOException.html) if this input stream has been closed by invoking the [close()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html#close()) method.

The available method for class InputStream always returns 0.

This method should be overridden by subclasses.
```

Unfortunately the only way to ensure this is to limit the input type as a ByteString which explicitly declares that `available()` will always return `size - current_pos`.

    InputStream stream = encodedValue.newInput();
    T result = coder.decode(stream, context);

      throw new CoderException(
          stream.available() + "" unexpected extra bytes after decoding "" + result);

In a regular `pd.merge()`, users cannot specify both `left_index` and `left_on`. (Instead, users have a `MultiIndex`). That means the `left_on` in `_get_merge_keys()` is always empty in a `pd.merge()`, but a `pd.merge_asof(left_index=True, left_by=...)` will result in a `left_on` array with a `None` in the middle of it.

I have concerns around the usage of `ThreadLocal` for things that most cases don't need to be thread local.

EDIT - Since this takes a `Callable`, it's less of a concern.

""Height Limit"" implies that if it was set to say, 50, the maximum height of the popup would be 50. But that is not what this does. This `extra_height_limit` is _subtracted_ from the actual height limit (usable parent rect). Essentially what it does is set a maximum Y position (highest allowable point) for the popup menu.

As a result, perhaps changing the name to something like `set_highest_allowable_point(int p_value)` would represent it better. I still don't think that `set_highest_allowable_point` is necessarily the best name, but I just want to get the idea of a name change out there.",Agree.,0,1

"This can be replaced with the function call to ""isCellExpired"" defined at line 530","The logic was a little different from checking a cellTs directly, in the sense that it requires finding the max ts first amongst different cells in the put, just that the comparison part is common. Didn't feel very strongly about creating a different function for that.",0,0

No need for the comments here.,Sorry about that.  I wanted to remind myself of the default state without an explicit assignment for the property (more relevant for the `final` properties where an assignment for the initializer would not work).,0,0

"@mehakmeet I noticed we introduced a new config option `fs.s3a.proxy.ssl.enabled`, but the port of the proxy is still set using `fs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled` [here](https://github.com/mehakmeet/hadoop/blob/8d7a7f74e62e4e37a91dc800cfbca698518ec37f/hadoop-tools/hadoop-aws/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/s3a/S3AUtils.java#L1323). Was wondering why need the new `fs.s3a.proxy.ssl.enabled` option? can we not use `fs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled` to set the protocol too? Asking here as this SDK V2 branch uses `fs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled` to set both protocol + port, but that causes this test to fail as it uses `fs.s3a.proxy.ssl.enabled`.","@mehakmeet I noticed we introduced a new config option `fs.s3a.proxy.ssl.enabled`, but the port of the proxy is still set using `fs.s3a.connection.ssl.enabled` [here](https://github.com/mehakmeet/hadoop/blob/8d7a7f74e62e4e37a91dc800cfbca698518ec37f/hadoop-tools/hadoop-aws/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/fs/s3a/S3AUtils.java#L1323).
